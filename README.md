# DATA-STUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHM-
When you start with Data Structures and Algorithms , the first thing you should do is to jot down all the topics at one place. And for the beginners start with the first topic, read about the topic ( you can read on GeeksforGeeks , LeetCode articles or any place where you are comfortable in), important algorithms and concepts and then move to the next one.

I am sharing my list of topics that I used when I started, and when you move on to the next topic, the feeling of cutting down the previous one is beyond amazing.

1. Bit Manipulation
2. Mathematics
3. Recursion and Backtracking
4. Arrays
5. Searching and Sorting
6. Hashing
7. Strings
8. LinkedList
9. Stack
10. Queues
11. Deque
12. Tree
13. Binary Search Tree
14. Heap
15. Greedy
16. Dynamic Programming
17. Graphs
18. Disjoint Set
19. Tries
20. Segment Trees

Hope this was helpful.
